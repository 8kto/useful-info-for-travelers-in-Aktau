# Useful info for travelers in Aktau (Kazakhstan)
This is a page with quick tips for those who traveling in Aktau, Mangystau. Firstly it was a short infoblock on our [couchsurfing profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/brightcurly) (and then not so short) but since CS is not a place for such info we decided to place it here, on [our travelblog](http://travelugi.com) (only in Russian).

Well, [this page on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktau) is clearly describes the city (optional).
Also [this article on wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Aktau) has very useful tips about the city despite being just a bit outdated. Its definitely worth to read.

## What to do in Aktau
In our opinion, best part of our city is a seashore. You can take a walk on the coast from 4th to 15th microdistrict; there are some wild places, but mostly it is a pleasant pavement.

There are several places in the city when you can meet foreigners (bar «Guns & Roses», also pub «Shamrock») if you are interested in nightlife (again, check map for the marks).

What about culture and outdoor trips? There are truly lot of sacred places (362 sites in sum) like ancient mosques and immemorial necropolises. Besides this, there are many nature beauties like oasises, canyones, and great-looking places on the seashore.

Main challenge here — all of this sites pretty far from the city. You have to rent a car (mostly SUV) or/and hire a guide to visit that places.

List of sites and more information:

- [Turism in Mangystau](http://en.mangystau.info/turizm/turism)
- [Interesting report by guy who has visited some of these sites](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/asia-central-asia/kazakhstan/aktau-and-mangistau-region)

## Camping
We have not any reports about such episodes, but we are pretty shure that its a bad idea to do camping inside the city. Its always crowded and moreover, there are police patrols that can catch you and provide some troubles. Try to find free place on a beaches like here: [first point](https://goo.gl/maps/vEU5YiL9fc22), [second one](https://goo.gl/maps/rbr4R4SNivH2), [another](https://goo.gl/maps/bYHiMzgWtLo) or outside the city. However there is a [public park Akbota](https://goo.gl/maps/Aau19Yh51p92) you could try.

## Hitchhike
In two words: it works. First you have to reach suburbs to catch a car to the right direction. You can use buses: bus number 3 goes towards the airport (but stops somewhere in the city end), bus number 2 or 3 goes towards the seaport (again, it stops somewhere nearby beach at district 1 (not 2nd bus, it goes further)). Be careful: buses goes in both directions (to and from).
